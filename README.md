# 0-SENSOR-VALUES-PREDICTION
This is a group project collaborated with Ravishankar Subramani Iyer in ML Course taught by Thomas Trappenberg. During the project, we explored the implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms from educational websites and traditional algorithms from a literature review to predict the failure scores of 103 sensor data of the subsequent year.
