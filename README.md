# 0-SENSOR-VALUES-PREDICTION

**This is the project that I have collaborated with Ravishankar Subramani Iyer, who provided the list of the candidate models & assisted the model tuning.**

**The project is under the instruction of Thomas Trappensberg, who taught us Machine Learning Fundamental (CSCI6505) during January 2023 and April 2023.**

**This final project ranked 2/28 classwide (test MSE = 352, despite interval is needed, see *Project Results.docx*). And the project scored 99/100 in that semester.**

[Abstract] Regression refers to the technique of modelling data which is continuous (measurable) in nature. To find the best regression model to predict sensor value, we explored multiple regression models from StackOverflow and research literature to make quantitative predictions of the failure scores of 103 sensors. From the 21 different regression models, GBDT performed the best in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (17.94 ± 2.62) and R2 scores (0.17 ± 0.22). Subsequently, we optimised the GBDT model to predict the failure scores of the 103 sensor values of the subsequent year. This project not only considers almost every possibility of regression prediction use cases but also ensures the coverage of the possible appropriate regression model to perform the best result.

**Original Data: *xTrain.py*, *yTrain.py*, *xTest.py***

***yTest.py* was reveiled & published by instructor after the project. Therefore, we conducted model training & fine-tuning based on three original data files above.**
